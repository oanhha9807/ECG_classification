# ECG Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for performing ECG (Electrocardiogram) classification. The project focuses on building a robust model to classify ECG signals into multiple diagnostic categories using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Features

- **Multi-class and multi-label classification**
- **Support for imbalance handling** with techniques like weighted loss and data augmentation
- **Visualization tools** for ECG signals and classification results
- **Preprocessing pipeline** for ECG data, including normalization, filtering, and feature extraction
- **Support for custom datasets**
- Modular design for easy experimentation with different models

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (select framework as per implementation)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch Lightning (if using PyTorch)
- WFDB (for working with PhysioNet datasets)

To install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

This project supports ECG datasets such as:

- **PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**
- **PTB Diagnostic ECG Database**
- Custom datasets in `.mat` or `.csv` format

### Data Format
Ensure the dataset is organized as follows:

```
data/
  train/
    0001.mat
    0002.mat
    ...
  test/
    0101.mat
    0102.mat
    ...
  labels.csv  # Labels in multi-label or multi-class format
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecg-classification.git
   cd ecg-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to prepare data for training:
```bash
python preprocess.py --data-dir ./data --output-dir ./processed
```

### Training

Train the model with the following command:
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate the model on the test set:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path ./models/best_model.pth --data-dir ./processed
```

### Visualization

Visualize ECG signals and results:
```bash
python visualize.py --data ./processed --results ./results
```

## Model Architecture

The project includes the following architectures:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
   - For feature extraction and classification.
   
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**
   - For capturing sequential dependencies in ECG signals.

3. **Hybrid Models:**
   - Combining CNN and RNN to leverage both feature extraction and temporal modeling.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **AUC-ROC**
- **Confusion Matrix**
